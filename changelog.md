# Changelog

## master

- Add implicit reconcile to remove unknown Mesos Tasks
- Add limitation of memory swap (DOCKER_MEMORY_SWAP, default value "1000" MB) the container can use
- Add API and cli to shutdown the K8 cluster (does not delete persistence volumes)
- Add API and cli to start the K8 cluster after a shutdown
- Add API and cli to restart the K8 cluster 
- Change kubeapi to a fix hostport. It would ever be the first port of the framework portrange
- Fix port detection if the framework is running as container at the same servers like the datastore and K8 manager
- Add support for Server labels
- Add REFUSE_OFFERS to tell mesos it does not have to send new offers during the next seconds (default: 120.0). That will give other 
  frameworks the chance to get offers more quickly.
- Bootstrap: Combine dashboard.yaml, dashboard_auth.yaml and dashboard_traefik.yaml into default.yaml. These file is the place to customize 
  k3s during the bootstrap process.
- Rewrite bootstrap server as Kubernetes Controller to simplify the bootstrap process and optimize cluster health checks.
- Add Kubernetes taint to prevent pods to run on the Kubernetes management node. With KÂ§S_ENABLE_TAINT you can enable(true and default)/disable(disable) these feature.
- Change the mesos cli plugin to avmesos-cli.
- Fix ClusterRestart API [#14](https://github.com/AVENTER-UG/mesos-m3s/pull/14) (thanks to [@itsoksarvesh](https://github.com/itsoksarvesh)).
